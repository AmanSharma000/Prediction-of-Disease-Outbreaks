# Prediction-of-Diseases-Outbreak
The timely prediction of disease outbreaks is crucial for early intervention and improved
healthcare outcomes. This study focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes, heart
disease, and Parkinsonâ€™s disease using machine learning techniques.
The main aim is to establish a prediction model which recognizes high-risk cases through
essential medical characteristics and life-style elements. Researchers used relevant medical
datasets to collect data which required preprocessing before applying machine learning
algorithms for building predictive models using Logistic Regression, Random Forest and
Support Vector Machines. Model validation uses accuracy metrics in combination with
precision and recall.
