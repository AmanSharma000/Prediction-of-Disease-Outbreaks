# Prediction-of-Diseases-Outbreak
The timely prediction of disease outbreaks is crucial for early intervention and improved
healthcare outcomes. This study focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes, heart
disease, and Parkinson’s disease using machine learning techniques.
The main aim is to establish a prediction model which recognizes high-risk cases through
essential medical characteristics and life-style elements.



o	This project uses machine learning to predict the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson’s disease. It involves training and evaluating models to analyze medical and lifestyle factors for early disease detection, with saved models deployed for future use.
o	A UI application was built using Streamlit to provide a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions. This project demonstrates expertise in data preprocessing, machine learning model development, deployment, and Python-based healthcare analytics.
